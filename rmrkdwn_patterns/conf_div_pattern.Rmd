## Conference and Division Records

Over the last five seasons, the `r details$name` are `r make_team_records(vs_conf$su_w, vs_conf$su_l, vs_conf$su_p)` against conference opponents and `r make_team_records(vs_div$su_w, vs_div$su_l, vs_div$su_p)` vs division opponents. 

### vs Division Opponents ATS by Team

```{r conf_div_tbl, echo=FALSE}
team_df %>% 
  get_div_games() %>% 
  group_by(opp) %>% 
  sum_up_records() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  div_results_tbl() %>% 
  kable(align = 'c')
```

### `r details$conf` Games

```{r conf_game_ats, echo=FALSE}
team_df %>% 
  get_conf_games() %>% 
  make_results_tbl() %>% 
  kable(align = 'c')
```

### `r paste(details$conf, details$div)` Games

```{r div_games_ats, echo=FALSE}
team_df %>% 
  get_div_games() %>% 
  make_results_tbl() %>% 
  kable(align = 'c')
```
